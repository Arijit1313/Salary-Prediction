# Salary-Prediction
This is my second Machine Learning Project where I have trained my model to predict the salaries of different employees under different conditions using my own choices/decisions as labels for training data and then testing them to predict the accuracy for the  same for a set of choices.This is the first stage,to make my model more complex in future.
